# rime-snomiao Multilingual IME (EN+JA+ZH)

The integrated input method for multilingual users now supports mixed input of Pinyin, Wubi, Roman letters, and English, with the addition of integrated vocabulary translation.

多语言使用者一体化输入法，集成词汇翻译混合编码输入，现在支持拼音+五笔+罗马字+英语混合输入。

多言語話者向けオールインワン入力ソリューション、統合語彙翻訳ハイブリッドコーディング入力、今ピンイン+五笔+ローマ字+英語の混合入力をサポート。

- Language: [English] | [简体中文](./README.chs.md)

## Why?

The project mainly solve the following issues:

- Can't type Chinese using the Japanese input method, and can't type Japanese using the Chinese input method, always having to switch. What to do? (Mixed Chinese and Japanese input)
- Additionally, the system's default Japanese input method can't directly type English... (Rime by pressing Enter)
- Know English and are learning Japanese, want to know how to say a word in Japanese? (Translate English words to Japanese)
- Know Chinese and are learning Japanese, want to know how to type the same character in Japanese? (Reverse lookup for Japanese)
- Know Wubi, but sometimes can't remember certain characters and want to use Pinyin. (Mixed Wubi and Pinyin input)
- Sometimes want to type some emojis 😈. (Convert Chinese characters to emojis)

- 🌠 Realize all these dreams simultaneously (using this solution)
